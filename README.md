Title: Sashaâ€™s Mini Data Analysis Project
Author: Sasha Tuttle

Background:
The overarching goal of this project is to familiarize myself with Github, data organization and tidyverse. There are 3 checkpoints for this project, each with their own 
individual goals. 

Milestone 1 [x] - October 14th 2021 (extension required)
 - familiarize myself with the datasets provided as well as my own.
 - Create four potential research questions to be further explored. 
 - Create a clear and reproducible report using R markdown.

Milestone 2 [ ] - October 19th 2021
 - Use packages dplyr and tidyr to manipulate and summarize my data.
 - Understand what 'tidy' data is and how to create it.
 - Better understand how to use R to answer research questions. 

Milestone 3 [ ] - October 28, 2021
 - Manipulate special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
 - Fit a model object to your data and extract a result.
 - Read and write data as separate files.

Pilot_study dataset description:
The Pilot_study.csv file contains data from a pilot study where I tested the 
effects of cross-pollination on three different varieties of *V. corymbosum* 
(highbush blueberry). I tested the effects of cross-pollination with regards to 
fruit yield (%), berry weight (g), TSS (%), pH, and titratable acid (TA). I hypothesized 
that blueberry flowers that received pollen from a different variety would have 
a higher yield and berry weight relative to flowers that received pollen from the 
same variety. I also hypothesized that blueberry flowers that were 
cross-pollinated would yield higher quality blueberries (high TSS, low pH, low TA)
relative to self-crossed blueberry flowers. Treatments were assigned to different 
branches of the same bush, so all of the measurements were taken for a whole 
cluster of berries. Note that the units for fruit set and TSS are in percent and the units for TA are mg citric acid/g formula weight (FW). 

The Minidata_true.rmd file contains the work done up until Milestone 1 for the Mini data analysis assignment for the stat545A course. 
The Minidata_true.md file is a knitted version of the Minidata_true.md file. 
The Minidata_true_files/figure-gfm folder includes the figures and plots created in Milestone 1.
