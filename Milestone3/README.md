Mini data analysis - Milestone 1

This folder includes all of my work for Milestone 1, the first part of this assignment.

Overall, it was my objective to practice manipulating factors using the "forcats" package, fit my data to a model to extract statistical results, and to practice reading 
and writing data. 

  - Milestone3_plots is a folder that includes all of the figures generated for Milestone 3.
  - Milestone3.rmd is the R markdown file that includes my work for Milestone 3.
  - Milestone3.md is the knitted version of Milestone3.rmd.
