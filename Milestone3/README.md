Mini data analysis - Milestone 3

This folder includes all of my work for Milestone 3, the final part of this assignment.

Overall, it was my objective to practice manipulating factors using the "forcats" package, fit my data to a model to extract statistical results, and to practice reading 
and writing data. Please note that unlike in Milestone 1 and 2 where I was mainly focused on working on my own dataset, I was forced to use the "parking_meters" data set to practice using the forcats package as any reasonable changes needed for my data did not require the use of the "forcats" package. 

  - Milestone3_plots is a folder that includes all of the figures generated for Milestone 3.
  - Milestone3.rmd is the R markdown file that includes my work for Milestone 3.
  - Milestone3.md is the knitted version of Milestone3.rmd.
