Mini data analysis - Milestone 2

This folder includes all of my work for Milestone 1, the first part of this assignment.

Overall, it was my objective to use the packages dplyr and tidyr to tidy my data, allowing me to pursue the research questions laid out in Milestone 1. 

  - Milestone2_plots is a folder that includes all of the figures generated for Milestone 2.
  - Milestone2.rmd is the R markdown file that includes my work for Milestone 2.
  - Milestone2.md is the knitted version of Milestone2.rmd.
